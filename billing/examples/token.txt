Bluesnap auto-login token

This code example (get_token.php) shows how to use Bluesnap (payment processing service) API in order to auto-login a registered shopper into a Buy-page. In case the shopper already placed orders in the past, the Buy-page will allow him/her to use the same credit-card that was used on the last purchase.

This PHP implementation is one step away from creating a single-click purchase, which is the ideal shopper experience.
In order to use this implementation, you should open a sandbox account on:
https://sandbox.plimus.com/jsp/new_developer.jsp

After you've registered and validated your account, go to "Settings --> API settings" and set your credentials up.
Got back to the account home page and follow the "getting started guide" in order to setup a product and a contract.
That's it, you're ready to go!

You can test the newly setup contract on this link (this example uses one of my contracts):
